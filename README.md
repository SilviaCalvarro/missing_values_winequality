Algorithms to find missing values in a dataset with decision trees

I have created three algorithms to find missing values on 'winequality-white' datastet with decision trees. The first code uses non-missing data and regresion tree to predict these missing values. Second and third algorithms improve the previous one by using mean and median values of the 7 classes and by calculating missing values according to that.
